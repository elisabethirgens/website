  section: ABOUT
  text: >-
    The company has its origins from InfoStream, which in 1997 developed the
    first version of the middleware Manamind Collect. Manamind was founded in
    2001, with Collect as the very corner stone of the company. Today a new
    version of Collect is still the foundation of our deliveries and is what
    allows us to collect vast amounts of real-time data and distribute it
    efficiently to our custom-made web solutions. With domain knowledge in the
    field of market data and finance we work hard to provide solutions with high
    quality, availability, flexibility and great design.
